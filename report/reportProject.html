		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>
			In this project we are trying to create a mashup of different APIs that are provided by social platforms
			(for example Facebook, Twitter, Redit). The mashup will be capable of representing different statistics
			computed from the available data. Some of those statistics may provide answers to the following questions:
			What kind of data is most popular on Facebook?, What website contains the highest volume of new information?, etc.
			The user of the website will be able to create custom statistics dynamically and also add new sources of
			data (new APIs), through the use of a page simulating the functionality of a file system.
			All the websites configurations (graphics and APIs) will be stored locally.
		</p>

		<h2>Ideas and Concepts</h2>
		<h3>File system</h3>
		<figure typeof="sa:Image">

			<figcaption>
				Drawing of the File system concept
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			We needed to use an easy and intuitive way to store different statistics and APIs. So we came up with the idea
			to replicate the functionality of a file system (see Google Drive for reference). There will be 2 separate
			systems one what contains the APIs and one with custom charts. We understand that a single list of the charts
			would get too cluttered eventually so we decided to incorporate a basic folder system where the user could
			organize his charts. We currently don't expect to have this problem with the APIs but we might chose
			to implement the folder system there in the future.
		</p>

		<h3>Custom APIs</h3>

			<img src="../assets/img/API%20Config.png" width="880" height="655">
			<figcaption>
				Drawing of the APIs configuration page concept
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			A user should be able to add his own APIs as long as he is able to tell the application how the data should
			be interpreted. This functionality is what makes the application easily extensible for future ways to add
			data. Even is a user is not experienced enough to add his own APIs we will also provide some default ones,
			those can later be remove if they are not desirable.
		</p>

		<h3>Custom Charts</h3>
		<figure typeof="sa:Image">
			<img src="../assets/img/Custom%20Chart.png" width="880" height="655">
			<figcaption>
				Drawing of the Custom chart configuration page concept
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			We thought that different users might have different needs for statistics. So we came up with the idea to let
			all users create their own charts. In practice to create a chart you need to select what data
			you wish to represent (number of text, number of chars in a text, number of images, etc.) and what type
			of representation you like to have (bar chart, pie chart, etc.). While we don't know yet what kind
			of data we will be able to extract from different APIs we will try to provide as many parameters as possible.
		</p>

		<!--
		<h3>Real Time Data</h3>
		<figure typeof="sa:Image">
			<img src="../assets/img/Real%20Time%20Data.png" width="880" height="655">
			<figcaption>
				Drawing of the Real Time Data page concept
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			As a neat addition to statistics we also wanted to add the possibility to view the extracted data directly.
			This page should be fairly easy to implement compared to the more complex statistics while also being
			extremely useful as it will be a able to provide a user with the ability to browse news from multiple
			places at once.
		</p>-->

	<section typeof="sa:MaterialAndMethods" id="user interaction">
		<h2>User interaction</h2>
		<p>
			When we built the concept for the application we considered two types of users: normal and advanced.
			For the normal user we will provide some example statistical graphs with information from the most common
			APIs.
			The more advanced user is expected to take full advantage of the configurable APIs and custom Graphs. We
			will provide this type of user with a way to add new APIs and configure them so that the application can
			interpret the data.

		<h2>APIs and Data storage</h2>
		<p>
			We build our application to run only on local storage. Data stored by our application will include user custom
			graphics, user custom APIs and data gathered by APIs. To prevent the issue with limited memory we are going
			to delete the oldest data provided by the APIs. Some examples of the APIs we will use to gather our data are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Facebook Graph API
			</li>
			<li>
				Twitterâ€™s API
			</li>
			<li>
				Reddit API
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Development Management</h2>
		<p>
			We used Github to organize our project. We split out tasks between us in the following way: creating
			the front page and navigation, creating the file system, creating the configuration page for the statistics
			and APIs and creating the statistics. We used Github projects to distribute tasks and track their
			progress between team members.
